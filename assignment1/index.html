          <p> <strong> 1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</strong> When I first opened the website, 
            the pastel ombre blue and purple colours caught my eye. After the Lunaverse was created, the 3D floating objects really stood out. When
             interacting with the website, I noticed how each category or section stood out more if you hovered over it. Such categories include omada,
              spark, coach+ and lab. The object within also moves upwards. You could also click on each section and it would automatically take you to 
              that page. Alternatively, you have the ability to scroll wheel to each section. Within each category, these 3D objects, each designed 
              specifically to what section you are in, still stood out to me. You can also interact with the 3D objects. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="inner2">
          <p> <strong> 2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. </strong> </p>   
          <ul>
            <li>- Hovering over each section</li>
            <li>- Clicking each section which automatically scroll the page to that area</li>
            <li>- Playing with the 3D objects and seeing what each one does</li>
            <li>- Using my scroll wheel to scroll through the website</li>
            <li>- Clicking the discover icon within each application</li>
            <li>- Reading through the descriptions of each application</li>
            <li>- Clicking the icons around the website to see what each one does</li>
          </ul>
          </div> 

          <div class="inner3">
            <p> <strong> 3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </strong> I spent most of the time engaging with the 
              3D objects on the website. For the first application, ‘Omada’, I spent a few minutes shooting the basketball and soccer ball into the goal, 
              which would then send out a bunch of flying coins if you scored. In the ‘Spark’ section, I found out you could open and close the laptop,
              turn on and off the phone, play around with the shoe and bubbles floating around, as well as shake the tree to make leaves fall. In the 
              ‘Coach+’ section, you can click the punching bag, flip the egg, and make the boxing gloves fight in the rink. </p>   
            </div> 
          
          <div class="inner4">
            <p> <strong> 4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? </strong> I spent a lot of my time on 
              this website left clicking different icons or sections. This is because most of the things in this website are accessible through left 
              clicking different buttons. You can also interact with the 3D objects by left clicking. Furthermore, in the ‘kitchenlab’ discover page,
              there is a series of images which loops throughout the page which you can left click to take a closer look. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="inner">
            <p> <strong> 5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </strong> The primary goal of this 
              website is to introduce various, potentially beneficial apps to its users. There are three apps that are presented to the audience; Omada, 
              Spark and Coach+. Omada allows users to engage in sports betting without losing real money. Therefore, users still share the feeling of
              winning, or losing, betting, and having various social interactions without any financial risk. I believe this is a good way to ensure it 
              is safe and fun for all ages, therefore all family and friends can partake in this experience. Spark gives you your own personal 3D virtual 
              coach which engages in sport sessions, fitness and dance. You can also customise and level up your virtual coach which gamifies your 
              experience and offers you rewards to help you stay motivated. This coach and all the music was designed by Luni which I find very impressive. 
              Finally, Coach+ gives you easy access to the full fitness experience. You can set goals and be provided with personalised workout routines 
              which take into account different training grounds and equipment. Accompanying this, Luni has partnered with UFC, one of the world’s largest 
              sports, in order to develop these personalised training sessions. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="inner2">
            <p> <strong> 6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal? </strong> This website makes it a fun and creative way to 
              promote applications. Rather than it being a random ad you might just skip, Luniverse incorporates fun colours and 3D objects you can 
              interact with. This helps the audience stay engaged and want to learn more about the website and contents inside. The layout is also very 
              simple and everything is easily accessible with multiple ways to do so. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="inner">
            <p> <strong> 7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) 
            </strong> This website is designed for short-term engagement as it provides details on three applications. Once the user has thoroughly read 
            through the descriptions or downloaded the apps, there is not much more content to further engage in. The user could potentially re-visit the 
            website to check for any updates or changes on the applications. Users can also check for other applications Luni might be promoting. However, 
            there are very few reasons why users would need to re-visit this website. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="inner2">
            <p> <strong> 8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time? </strong> This website does not 
              provide many features that would encourage users to repeatedly engage with it. Although a first time visit would be very fascinating due to 
              its colours and 3D interactive objects, once a user has read through its detailed descriptions on the three applications being promoted, 
              there is not much else to do. Users may be persuaded to download one of the applications where they would then repeatedly engage with the app 
              but not the website. No personalisation or progress tracking is used within the website.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="inner3">
            <p> <strong> 9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? </strong> Some physical structures are featured 
              within the website which users can interact with. This includes a soccer ball and a goal, and a basketball and hoop which you can left click 
              to shoot a goal. The Coach+ section of the website also showcases equipment and items associated with the gym. Such things include barbells, 
              a gym bag and a bar. For the Omada application, Luni draws on an individual's desire to play games or potential addiction in betting money, 
              and turns it into a fun, safe application for all ages. Furthermore, the beginning of each discovery page for each application is similar to 
              billboards. This is due to the large fonts that are implemented which make the name of the application stand out. There is also an image or 
              video in the beginning giving you insight on the format of the application. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="inner4">
            <p> <strong> 10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience? </strong> 
              The use of 3D objects within the website encourages users to interact with and engage in the website. It utilises various fonts, images and 
              videos to help grab your attention and convince you to download the applications. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="inner">
            <p> <strong> 11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience? </strong> 
              Users may feel different depending on which application description they are reading through. The first one, Omada, users may feel excitement 
              as they are given the opportunity to bet on sports without losing real money. A younger audience may be thrilled as they can enjoy the sensations 
              of betting on games without any risk. In contrast, some individuals may feel it is useless as the emotions they feel may depend on whether they 
              are going to win money or not. The second app, Spark, may motivate users to engage in sports and dance. They might feel more comfortable in doing 
              so with the personalised coach guiding them on the app. Finally, Coach+ may also motivate its users to set fitness or nutrition goals. It is 
              very convenient as everything you would need is all in one place on this app. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="inner2">
            <p> <strong> 12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating? </strong> When opening the 
              discover page for each application, it opens up a new section therefore you have to close it before you can access any other part of the website. 
              Although it is something small, it is a little inconvenient and makes it a little less user friendly. <strong> 13) What is the most satisfying 
              part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying? </strong> The most satisfying part of the interaction is the 3D objects that 
              you can move and play with. It was interesting to see what each object would do if I clicked on it or moved my cursor around it. </p>
